min_simple_len2:
Minimum model, mostly exists to test training a model with sequences of data.
Takes simple_normed data (data and label are scaled down w.r.t. the origin such that distance from the origin to the label is 1 unit)
Structure:
24 tanh (input) -> 3 linear (output)
Trained for 100 epochs
min_simple_len2_gen2:
Somewhat larger model
Takes simple_normed data
Structure:
24 tanh (input) -> 12 tanh -> 3 linear (output)
Trained for 100 epochs
min_simple_len2_gen3:
Yet Again Larger
Takes simple_normed data
Structure:
24 tanh (input) -> 24 tanh -> 24 tanh -> 3 linear (output)
