simple_normed:
(4 * 3 * seq_len) input dimensions
3 output dimensions
Data and label in upper body's reference frame -> gaussian noise of (0, 65) added to entire sequence -> scaled down so that distance from label to nearest data point is 1
no_normed:
Same as simple_normed, but data is not scaled down at all
flat_normed:
no_normed, but scaled down by factor of 500 to ensure all data is in or near (-1, 1) range
